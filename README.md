# JavaScriptGame
WELCOME TO THE SNAKE GAME. I am sure lots of you have seen the snake game around. This application was made of pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and uses a Python a port/server

HOW TO PLAY: Once the game is loaded use the arrow keys to move the snake. Eat as much food as you can without "dying"

HOW TO START THE GAME: 

- Open up your terminal and paste this command "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" 

- You are required to use a different server and or port due to security measures with the game. I chose a quick easy python command that gives you access to a port

- Once the command is typed in and port/server is running go to your browser. Once at your browser paste this link http://0.0.0.0:8000/

- This will open the port and allow you to play the game

ENJOY!
